# Core Tenets
## 1. Focus on fundamentals
- Don't get caught up in specific tools or methodologies
- Don't get complicated
- The goal isn't to be an expert developer (or even an entry level developer) the goal is to understand key concepts relating to computer science and coding
## 2. Keep it fun
- We want to keep things fun and engaging, gamify as much as possible
- Make barriers to entry as low as possible
- Keep lessons age appropriate (pre-literate children)
  - A lesson shouldn't last more than 15 minutes 
- Keep learning multi-modal: kids should feel free to touch, manipulate, and move not just listen, watch, and read
## 3. Prefer "unplugged" activities to activities with a screen
- Since the goal isn't learning how to program, being hands-on with computers is not the most important thing
- The main goal is to deliver a SOLID understanding and mastery of computational thinking; this can be done mostly thorough unplugged activities
- When possible get kids moving and physically engaged
## 4. Remember the audience, pre-literate children
- The children this cirriculum is developed for are pre-literate children
- The people delivering the cirriculum are likely to be parents with no coding/development experience
- There should always be instructor guides to facilitate the cirriculum
## 5. Keep it free and open
- The resources used should cost nothing and should be publicly available
- It is ok to assume reasonable household materials (i.e. utensils, toys, candies/treats, etc...)
