- ### [K-12 Computer Science Framework](https://k12cs.org/)
>The K–12 Computer Science Framework represents a vision in which all students engage in the concepts and practices of computer science. Beginning in the earliest grades and continuing through 12th grade, students will develop a foundation of computer science knowledge and learn new approaches to problem solving that harness the power of computational thinking to become both users and creators of computing technology.
[K-12 Computer Science Framework - Vision](https://k12cs.org/a-vision-for-k-12-computer-science/)
- Developed by a steering committee including Code.org
- Several **Key Principles**:
  - Broaden participation in computer science
  - Focus on the essential
  - Do not reinvent the wheel
  - Inform with current research and guide future research
  - Align to nationally recognized frameworks
  - Inspire implementation

### [Girls who code](https://girlswhocode.com/)
- Girls who code is all about closing the gender gap in computer science. Some key information mentioned on the [about us page](https://girlswhocode.com/about-us) includes:
>In 1995, 37% of computer scientists were women. Today, it’s only 24%. The percent will continue to decline if we do nothing. We know that the biggest drop off of girls in computer science is between the ages of 13 and 17.
> GIRLS WHO CODE IS CHANGING THE GAME...We're reaching girls around the world and are on track to close the gender gap in new entry-level tech jobs by 2030.

## Articles on Teaching kids to code
### [A 5-step guide to teaching kids coding (Article)](https://livecodestream.dev/post/a-5-step-guide-to-teaching-kids-coding/)
This article offers 5 key tips on helping kids learn to code and focuses on interest based learning.
1. Find their passion - target learning to their passion (build a game for gamers, visual focused project for artistic kids, etc...)
2. Start with a visual language - Traditional languages might be a bit much for a young (especially pre-reader) child.
   - [Scratch Jr](https://www.scratchjr.org/)
   - [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)
   - [Snap](https://snap.berkeley.edu/)
   - [Blockly by Google](https://opensource.google/projects/blockly)
   - [Alice](https://www.alice.org/)
3. Start Small - Don't push kids too hard but keep it fun and challenging
4. Build resilience through failures - Remind child that making mistakes is a chance to learn and not something to be upset about.
5. Build on success - Congratulate and celebrate ALL successes. Use momentum to keep them going

### [Top 7 Computer Science Basics All Kids Should Learn (Article)](https://junilearning.com/blog/guide/coding-basics-kids-should-learn/)
- We need to establish learning goals prior to starting so that we can consider `what specifically do we want the child(ren) to learn?`
- There are 7 things important to include in learning goals for coding:
 1. Algorithms - Even though children may not know it they are already familiar with algorithims (like how to brush their teeth, how to tie their shoes, how to make a sandwhich, how to choose a show on Netflix)
 2. Sequencing - Sequencing is important in algorithims, while an algorithim has to tell you what steps you take sequencing orders those steps. Following instructions for a Lego kit is a great example of how children do this already.
 3. Conditionals - Children are already familiar with conditionals (if toys on floor, pick them up), (if mommy and daddy are talking, don't interrupt)
 4. Loops - Children are familiar with looping through things like taking turns
 5. Coordinates - Coordinates are more advanced and relate directly to math but it's still important to cover
 6. Variables - Children may have a hard time grasping this one initially but it's important for them to understand that some values may be unknown or changing.
 7. Functions - Children already have an idea of how functions work (an input drives an output) i.e. turning the doorknob causes the door to be able to be opened

### [CS Fundamentals for Elementary Schools (Article)](https://code.org/educate/curriculum/elementary-school)
- This is an article published by [Code.org](https://code.org) that is aimed to help educators learn how to teach computer science in elementary school
- This article links out to the [Code.org Computer Science Fundamentals Path](https://code.org/educate/curriculum/csf)
- This article outlines the research that goes into why it's important to teach kids to code including benefits like better testing scores
- Links out to the [Computer Science Teachers of America Standards](https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards) and explains how code.org cirriculum is built upon them.

### [Teach Your Kids to Code: A Guide for Parents (Article)](https://www.create-learn.us/blog/teach-your-kids-to-code/)
>Kids who code learn important problem-solving skills, develop perseverance, and hone their creativity.
- Ensure you are using **age appropriate** methods when introducing coding to children
 - Block-based/visual languages are very helpful for young children
- Keep in mind, **coding is creativity** while it is related to STEM, Coding is a great creative outlet
- Work to **inspire curiosity** in the child. Let children experiment and learn
- Help children to **explore and nurture passions** - it's way easier to learn when you can apply it to something you enjoy, same goes for kids
- Consider using **social coding** by doing things like "hackathons" and pair programming. Make sure kids don't feel isolated during their learning
- **Mentorship** can be important as kids progress
