# Brainstorming
- We want to ensure we are sticking to our [core tenets](../core-tenets.md)
- We will utilize research gathered in our [resources document](resources.md)

## Defining Learning Goals
1. Understand what an algorithim or recipie is
2. Understand the importance of sequencing in an algorithim or recipie
3. Understand conditional logic at a high level
4. Understand looping, espeicially as relates to patterns
5. Understand the basic use and purpose of variables
6. Understand the basic purpose of a function
7. Understand coordinates at a high level
8. Understand digital vs analog representations at a very basic level
9. Demonstrate the ability to create a basic algorithim

### Clarification
- The Learning Goals should be generalized and need not directly relate to code.
- **Algorithim or recipie** - Brushing one's teeth, baking a cake, or making a sandwhich can all be given as examples of an algorithim
