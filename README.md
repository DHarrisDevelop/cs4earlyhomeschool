# Computer Science Cirriculum for Early Homeschool
- This repository was started by Devin Harris who is currently the sole contributor and maintainer of the project but other individuals are encouraged and welcome to fork and or submit pull requests against the repository.
- This project is meant to be a place to organize thoughts and cirriculum for early childhood education relating to computer science.
- The targeted age group is 4 years to 6 years old, or a "pre-reader" group.
- The preference will be for all free and open resources to make this cirriculum as accessible as possible to as many people as possible

## Resources
- There is a [resources](https://github.com/DHarrisDevelop/cs4earlyhomeschool/blob/main/research/resources.md) file which lists several resources that may be used in developing the cirriculum and lesson plans

## Core Tenets
- Core tenets that go into development and maintenance of this project can be found in [core-tenets.md](core-tenets.md)
